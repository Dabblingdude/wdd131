			<h1>Bridget's Keepsake Quilts & Bears Site Plan</h1>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 2-3------------------------------ -->
			<hr />
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
                The purpose of this site is to provide a place on the web for my mom to showcase
                and advertise her quilting products. She runs a business of selling customized 
                quilts and bears, and we can use this site to help in that business. For now it will
                just be within a smaller scope for the sake of the class, but I will expand on it 
                at a later date with her to improve productivity and functionality.
            </p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
                The audience for this website is any potential customers for my mom's business.
            </p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
                I will use JS to implement modals for the pictures of her past projects.
                I will use JS to make at least 1 image gallery where the users can click on arrows 
                to view the next pictures.
                I will also make an extra simple subpage for a contact-me form submission for potential orders.
                If I figure it out, I will use JS to pull images from her FB page so that I can 
                have it automatically update with the most recent projects. If I do that, I may be 
                able to treat the posts as objects in an array. If not, I will do so with the main page's 
                images and maybe make them random in order to an extent.
            </p>

                Hello, I have been quilting for about 20 years. Some of my favorite quilts have 
                been memory quilts. My first memory quilt that I made was from my motherâ€™s hankies.
                Memory quilts and bears can be made from loved ones clothes, baby clothes that you 
                have been saving, jeans or t-shirts. It is a beautiful way to wrap yourself in 
                cherished memories.
                Please contact me if you would like for me to make you one of these timeless treasures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am waiting on my mother to send me the originals of the pictures she would like 
                most on the main page. It will feature the various types of things she can make 
                beyond just quilts and bears
            </p>
